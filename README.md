# Clippy Profile Picture movement

## A movement by Louis Rossman

### Introduction
With companies like Meta being able to [advertise beauty products to you by just deleting your images](https://futurism.com/facebook-beauty-targeted-ads). And Adobe no longer allowing you to buy out their Creative Suite forcing you to use their Creative Cloud subscription and making it so if you try to cancle early they can hit you with a early cancelasion fee. [While Google can ban your account and phone number for sending to a doctor a image of your child to see what that bump could be.](https://www.techspot.com/news/95729-google-refuses-reinstate-account-man-after-flagged-medical.html).

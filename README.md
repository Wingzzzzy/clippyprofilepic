## Disclamer
This site is a fan made effort about the Clippy movement as people made pump and dump under the clippy name so i made this a one stop shop about the movement with some resources, and the project being open source you can contribute to make the site better. 

## What?
With companies like Meta being able to [advertise beauty products to you by just deleting your images](https://futurism.com/facebook-beauty-targeted-ads), and Adobe no longer allowing you to buy out their Creative Suite, forcing you to use their Creative Cloud subscription and hitting you with an early cancellation fee if you try to cancel early, [while Google can ban your account and phone number for sending a doctor an image of your child to see what that bump could be](https://www.techspot.com/news/95729-google-refuses-reinstate-account-man-after-flagged-medical.html), the tech industry has been going downhill for a very long time. It's forcing changes that we never wanted, from Software as a Service (SAAS) to making us the product by selling our faces, voices, memories, and the way we talk. It's becoming more and more like a bad horror film that lets companies be a governing body, but the sad part is that it's becoming real. Thankfully, there are many attempts to push back on this corporate overreach, like the Stop Killing Games movement and even calling on Visa and MasterCard to find out why they are censoring legal adult products. Now, some people have decided to use Clippy, once an icon of useless, nagging assistants from Microsoft, as a beacon of how much better things were.

## Why?
While Clippy was very much hated for a long time, now more people look at it with nostalgia, as all it wanted to do was help you with your writing. He never wanted to see what you were writing, only giving you hints and tips on how to write something. And now it's a symbol of wanting to get rid of tech reading and seeing every action we do, started by Louis Rossmann, a Right to Repair activist and business owner, seeing how tech is becoming more and more controlling of us. He even launched the Consumer Rights Wiki, which you can find in Resources or [HERE](https://consumerrights.wiki/). He had a call to action for all people who are tired of the modern tech industry to change our avatars to Clippy on everything, even on workplace Slacks. And we ask you to not only join us but get informed about all things that are happening in the world of tech, and also fight by learning how to unchackle yourself from big tech, from DeGoogling to fully self-hosting your own cloud hosting and DNS for DNS-level adblocking. In the resources, I have added a few resources.
